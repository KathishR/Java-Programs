QUESTION :
___________
The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must print the first character and then the third character and then the sixth character and so on from the end as the output.
Note: The interval between the printed characters increases by 1 each time.

Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= Length of S <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains S.
Output Format: The first line contains the characters based on the given conditions.

<b>Example Input/Output 1:</b>
*******************************
Input:
    abcdefghijklmno
Output:
    omjfa

Explanation:

The string is abcdefghijklmno.
The first character from the end of the string is so is printed.
The third character from the end of the string is, the interval between o and m is 1, so is printed.
The sixth character from the end of the string is, the interval between m and j is 2, so is printed.
The tenth character from the end of the string is, the interval between j and f is 3, so is printed.
The fifteenth character from the end of the string is, the interval between f and a is 4, so is printed.
Hence the output is omjfa

OUTPUT :
__________
import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		String s = sc.next();
		int v =0;
		int v2=0;
		int i= s.length()-1;
		  while(v<s.length() && i-v2>=0)
		  {
		      System.out.print(s.charAt(i-v2));
		      if(v==0)
		        v+=1;
		      v+=1;
		      v2+=v;
		  }

	}
}
