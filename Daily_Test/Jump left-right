Question :

A boy is currently at the point 0 on a coordinate axis. He jumps by the following rules.

The first jump is X units to the right, the second jump is Y units to the left, the third jump is X units to the right, the fourth jump is Y units to the left and so on. The program must accept three integers X, Y and K as the input. The program must print the position of the boy after K jumps as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):

1 <= X, Y, K <= 10^9

Input Format:

The first line contains X, Y and K separated by a space.

Output Format:

The first line contains the position of the boy after K jumps.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input 523

Output:

8

Explanation:

Here X=5, Y=2 and K=3.

In the first jump, the boy jumps 5 units to the right. Now the current position of the boy is 5 (0 + 5).

In the second jump, the boy jumps 2 units to the left. Now the current position of the

boy is 3 (5-2).

In the third jump, the boy jumps 5 units to the right. Now the current position of the boy is 8 (3 + 5).

The final position of the boy is 8 (after 3 jumps). So 8 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:

Input: 100 1 4

    public static void main(String[] args) {

		long y=sc.nextLong();
		long k=sc.nextLong();
		long j=0;
		for(int i=0;i<k;i++)
		{
		    if(i%2==0)
		        j+=x;
		    else
		        j-=y;
		}
		System.out.print(j);
